<h1>The Selenium Browser Automation Project</h1>

<p>Selenium is an umbrella project for various tools and libraries that
 enable automation of web browsers.
 Amongst other things it provides the support infrastructure
 for the <a href=//w3c.github.com/webdriver>W3C WebDriver specification</a>,
 that lets you write interchangable code for all major web browsers.

<p>The project is made possible by volunteer contributors
 who have put in thousands of hours of their own time,
 and made the source code freely available
 under the <a href=license.html>Apache 2.0 license</a>.

<p>Here is one of the simplest Selenium instructions you can make:

<pre><code class=python>from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get("http://google.com/?hl=en")
search_box = driver.find_element_by_id("q")
search_box.send_keys("cheese")
search_box.submit()</code></pre>

<p>After you've installed Selenium and run this program
 you will see the browser navigate to the search engine
 and enter “cheese” into the search field before submitting the form.

<p>See the <em><a href=quick.html>Quick Tour</a></em>
 for a full explanation of what goes on behind the scenes when you run this code.
 You should continue on to the <a href=#narrative>narrative documentation</a>
 to understand how you can use Selenium as a test automation tool
 and to scale simple tests like this to run in large,
 distributed environments on multiple browsers,
 under several different operating systems.
