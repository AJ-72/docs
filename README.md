We're rewriting the Selenium documentation from scratch!
Help us out by sending us a patch!

Once this documentation reaches a state of relative stability and completeness,
it will replace the existing Selenium documentation.

**Warning:** This repo does not host the official Selenium documentation.
You can find the official documentation at http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/.

We accept patches and pull requests from GitHub.
