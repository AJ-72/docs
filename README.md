The New Selenium Docs
=====================

We're rewriting the Selenium docs from scratch!  Help us out by
forking and sending pull requests!

Writing each line with no longer than 122 chars is preferred but not
required.  This allows the markdown editor in GitHub to display all
content without running off the edge of the screen since the editor
does not have the ability to wrap at the edge.

Pull Requests
-------------

We accept pull requests from GitHub.  When making the pull request,
please indicate that you have filled in the
[CLA](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dFFjXzBzM1VwekFlOWFWMjFFRjJMRFE6MQ#gid=0).
